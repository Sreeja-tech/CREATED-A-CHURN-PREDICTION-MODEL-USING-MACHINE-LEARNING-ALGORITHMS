# CREATED-A-CHURN-PREDICTION-MODEL-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-ALGORITHMS

A churn prediction model for a telecom company aims to identify customers who are at a high risk of canceling their service or subscription. "Churn" in this context refers to the loss of customers or subscribers. Predicting churn allows telecom companies to proactively address customer concerns, offer promotions, or take other retention-focused actions to minimize revenue loss.

We performed Feature Selection and Feature Engineering techniques to optimize the dataset for analysis. Used Machine Learning Algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forests and also used Neural Networks to perform churn prediction. We have checked the accuracy without performing Feature Engineering at first and then checked the accuracy after performing Feature Engineering and compared the accuracies. Used Power BI and matplotlib to create informative visualizations of the data.
