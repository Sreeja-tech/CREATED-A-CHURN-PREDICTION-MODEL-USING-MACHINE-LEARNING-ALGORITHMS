# CREATED-A-CHURN-PREDICTION-MODEL-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-ALGORITHMS

Performed Feature Selection and Feature Engineering to optimize the dataset for analysis.
Used Machine Learning Algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forests and also used Neural Networks to perform 
churn prediction.
Used Power BI and matplotlib to create informative visualizations of the data.
